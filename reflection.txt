Learned: 
about RL, NN, etc.
About reserach process:
	Seeing signs of bad coding / bad seperation of concerns (like using lots of flags), which came to light when switching to different env
	Doing things too far in advance: reading a lot about safety RL, shielding, and already minding it while coding, while not used -> doings things more iteratively
	
Improvement over research internship:
	Better organisation:
		Versioning
		Keeping track of what done and what to do; weekly task docs and long term todo docs
