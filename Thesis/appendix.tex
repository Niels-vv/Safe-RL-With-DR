\section{Rl agent architectures}\label{appendix-agents}
Here we will lay out the details of the architecture and hyperparameter settings that were used in each agent mentioned in section \ref{research-method}. We will start by showing the vanilla agent, which uses an architecture and hyperparameters that are shared by all agents. For all other agents, each extending this vanilla agent, we will only give the additional architecture and parameters.
